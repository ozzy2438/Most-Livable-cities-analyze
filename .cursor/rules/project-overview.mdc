# City Livability Index Project Overview

This project analyzes the livability of different cities based on five key metrics:
- 🌬️ Air Quality (OpenWeatherMap API)
- 💼 Economic Indicators (FRED API)
- 🚔 Safety (Crime Statistics)
- 🎓 Education Quality (Urban Institute Education Data API)
- 🏥 Health Indicators (CDC/HealthData.gov APIs)

The project aims to calculate livability scores for cities like New York, Chicago, Austin, Miami, Denver (USA), and Istanbul (Turkey) for comparison.

The main project plan is in [city_livability_project.md](mdc:city_livability_project.md), which contains the entire project structure and code.
