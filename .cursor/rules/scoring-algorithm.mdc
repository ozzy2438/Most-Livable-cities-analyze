# Livability Scoring Algorithm

The livability score is calculated using a weighted average of five key metrics:

| Metric | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Air Quality | 20% | Based on AQI (Air Quality Index) |
| Economic Indicators | 25% | Based on unemployment rate |
| Safety | 20% | Based on crimes per 100k residents |
| Education | 20% | Based on graduation rates and school quality |
| Health | 15% | Composite of life expectancy, hospital ratings, etc. |

## Normalization

All metrics are normalized to a 0-10 scale:

- For positive metrics (higher is better): 
  `score = ((value - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)) * 10`

- For negative metrics (lower is better):
  `score = 10 - ((value - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)) * 10`

## Categorization

Final livability scores are categorized as:
- **Mükemmel (Excellent)**: 8.5-10.0
- **Çok İyi (Very Good)**: 7.5-8.4
- **İyi (Good)**: 6.5-7.4
- **Orta (Average)**: 5.5-6.4
- **Zayıf (Poor)**: 0.0-5.4

The main scoring algorithm implementation is in [city_livability_project.md](mdc:city_livability_project.md) in the `scoring_algorithm.py` section.
