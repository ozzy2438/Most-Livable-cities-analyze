# Data Visualization

The project includes several visualizations created using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

1. **General Ranking Chart**: Horizontal bar chart showing the overall livability scores for all cities

2. **Metric Comparison**: Grouped bar chart comparing different metrics (air quality, economic situation, safety) across cities

3. **Correlation Heatmap**: Shows the correlation between different metrics and the final livability score

4. **Scatter Plot**: Air Quality vs. Safety with:
   - Point size representing the overall livability score
   - Color representing the economic score
   - City names annotated on each point

The visualizations are saved to `data/final/livability_analysis.png` and display the multi-dimensional nature of the livability analysis.

Visualizations are created in the `visualization.py` module as detailed in [city_livability_project.md](mdc:city_livability_project.md).
